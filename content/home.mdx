I design and build data/platform systems and agentic pipelines — and I like shipping small, high-polish sites when a UI is the best way to make an idea feel tangible.

<Callout variant="tip" title="What’s here">

This site is intentionally **MDX-first**. The bio, CV, and each project live in `content/*.mdx` and are rendered with the same components.

## Current focus

- Data + platform engineering, with strong architecture fundamentals.
- Agentic pipelines and tooling that stays practical (fast feedback, clear UX).
- Turning “notes” into durable, browseable knowledge.
