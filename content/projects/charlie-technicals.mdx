Charlie Technicals is where I capture the higher-signal technical output that comes out of building: breakdowns, architecture notes, and detailed writeups that are meant to be shared.

## Why it’s cool

- **High signal, low friction:** the goal is to preserve the useful parts of exploration without turning it into a heavyweight documentation process.
- **Readable by humans first:** strong structure and consistent formatting so posts feel like a coherent library, not a pile of notes.
