Constructive is a simple idea with a big payoff: when a comment thread gets long, the best insights get buried. This project is about pulling the signal back to the surface.

## Why it’s cool

- **Outcome-first:** the UI is built around “what do I need to do / decide?” instead of “show me everything.”
- **Built for real use:** it’s designed to be fast to scan, easy to share, and practical in day-to-day workflows.
