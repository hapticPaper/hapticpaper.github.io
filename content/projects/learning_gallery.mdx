Learning Gallery is the “browse mode” for a bunch of small ideas: experiments, notes, prototypes, and the kind of work that’s usually scattered across docs and folders.

## Why it’s cool

- **MDX as the source of truth:** pages are written like documents, but can still embed components when a diagram, chart, or callout is the right tool.
- **Designed for scanning:** strong typography, consistent structure, and navigational cues make it easy to skim and then go deep.

This repo is the reference model for how I want content-driven sites to feel: structured, beautiful, and easy to extend.
